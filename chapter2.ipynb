    "# Financial Simulation: How Long Will It Take to Reach Your Savings Goal?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are planning to save for a specific financial goal, such as a down payment on a house, a new car, or a dream vacation. This program simulates your financial journey to estimate how long it will take to reach your target amount, considering that your income and expenses change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Variables (Inputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation starts with the following initial values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `saving_goal`: The total amount of money you want to save (e.g., **$10,000**).\n",
    "- `monthly_income`: Your initial monthly income (e.g., **$1,000**).\n",
    "- `month_expenses`: Your initial monthly expenses (e.g., **$600**).\n",
    "- `expense_growth_rate`: The monthly rate at which your expenses increase (e.g., **3%** or `0.03`).\n",
    "- `month_of_raise`: The interval, in months, at which you receive a pay raise (e.g., every **6 months**).\n",
    "- `raise_amount`: The amount your monthly income increases by when you get a raise (e.g., **$300**).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation proceeds on a month-by-month basis, applying the following rules in each cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Calculate Monthly Savings**: The savings for the current month are calculated by subtracting expenses from income.\n",
    "2.  **Expense Growth**: At the end of each month, expenses are not static; they increase by the `expense_growth_rate`.\n",
    "3.  **Income Raise**: At specific intervals (e.g., every 6 months), the monthly income is increased by the `raise_amount`.\n",
    "4.  **Stopping Condition**: The simulation stops when the `total_saving` reaches or exceeds the `saving_goal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The program's goal is to calculate and display the total time required, in **years** and **months**, to achieve the savings goal. It will also report the final amount saved upon completion."
